===================

My Homepage:

There were 5 main files in this project.
1) index.html - I made this my homepage with links to the other two html files.
2) resume.html - this is my resume. I set it up the way I set up the one I have made already in a word document, broken down into sections. Each of these types of sections is lead by a different header type and thus the formatting is different.
3) bio.html - this is a short biography. It's fairly simple and I put a link back to the main homepage at the bottom of it.
4) simple.css - This is a CSS file containing a basic formatting setup for documents I will use in the future (in addition to these documents).
5) handheld.css - This is triggered if the device the webpage is being viewed on is greater than 640 pixels. I chose this number since it's the width of the iPhone.
